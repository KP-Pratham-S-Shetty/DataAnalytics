### Handwritten Digit Prediction

**Handwritten Digit Prediction** is a machine learning project aimed at developing a highly accurate model to classify handwritten digits (0-9). This model ensures precision and recall, generalizes well to new data, avoids overfitting, and can be deployed in real-world applications like optical character recognition (OCR) systems.
